Hi! I am a Postdoc at [MARVL](https://marvl.stanford.edu), the Medical AI and Computer Vision Lab at Stanford University, where I am advised by [Serena Yeung-Levy](https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/). 

My research is at the intersection of AI and computer vision, with a focus on automating the spatial and semantic understanding of video. I am particularly interested in dynamic, high-stakes environments—such as surgery—that involve fine-grained actions, complex visual scenes, and decision processes that are difficult to capture exhaustively in standard datasets. By integrating multi-modal data, I aim to develop adaptable models that can interpret real-world scenarios, with the goal of supporting clinical decisions, enhancing surgical training, and improving the safety of interventions.

Before joining MARVL, I completed my PhD at University College London, where I was part of the [Surgical Robot Vision](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/surgical-robot-vision/) Group advised by Dan Stoyanov. During my PhD, I also interned at Niantic in London. Prior to that, I received an MSc in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from UCL and a BSc in Mathematics and Economics from the University of Mannheim.
