Hi! I am a Postdoc at [MARVL](https://marvl.stanford.edu), the Medical AI and Computer Vision Lab at Stanford University, where I am advised by [Serena Yeung-Levy](https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/). 

My research focuses on medical AI and aims to automate the spatial and semantic understanding of surgical scenes from videos. By integrating AI into the operating room, I hope to improve the safety of surgical procedures and democratize surgical skill.

Before joining MARVL, I earned my Ph.D. from University College London, where I was part of the [Surgical Robot Vision](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/surgical-robot-vision/) Group advised by [Dan Stoyanov](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/32290-danail-stoyanov). I received my M.Sc. in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from UCL, and my B.Sc. in Mathematics in Economics from University of Mannheim.
