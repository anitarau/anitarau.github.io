Hi! I am a Postdoc with [Serena Yeung-Levy](https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/) at the [Medical AI and Computer Vision Lab](https://marvl.stanford.edu) at Stanford University. My research focuses on AI for surgery, where I develop models that enable spatial and semantic understanding of surgical scenes from videos. By integrating AI into the operating room, I aim to enhance surgical safety and democratize surgical training.

Before joining MARVL, I earned my PhD from University College London, where I conducted research within the [Surgical Robot Vision](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/surgical-robot-vision/) Group.
